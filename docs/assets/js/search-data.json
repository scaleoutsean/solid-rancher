If we document those parameters by glancing at HCC deployment logs, we can then use ez-rancher to deploy Management Cluster in a manner consistent with HCC.

These aren’t currently documented specifically for the Rancher on HCI solution or even in the NetApp Trident documentation, but use SolidFire, Kuberetes and Trident features and therefore do not directly depend on Rancher itself. In theory we could use vSphere SRM and SolidFire SRA to failover VMs running Rancher, but that would be complicated approach and I doubt we’ll see it officially recommended. Awesome SolidFire has examples of how Target IQNs differ between clusters. YouTube has a demo of how PowerShell can be used to pair clusters, create replication relationship between two SolidFire storage clusters. It takes 30 seconds. YouTube also has a (longish, 15 min) video with a demonstration of SolidFire storage cluster failover and failback in a K8s/Trident environment. BC through Kubernetes . If services running on Kubernetes are designed and protected in a storage-independent approach, BC can be obtained independently of SolidFire storage. Example: a Web site backed by a NOSQL cluster with Web and Database containers spread across multiple sites running indepdent NetApp HCI or SolidFire clusters. Backup and Recovery . Rancher provides its own “snapshot” feature that can backup cluster configuration to a local disk or S3 storage such as NetApp StorageGRID or Public Cloud Object Storage. For cluster configuration I would prefer that over VMware or SolidFire snapshots or backups. For cluster data, you could use application backups or a 3rd party backup software that can backup K8s containers (see Awesome SolidFire). ",

Choices: . | Use existing Datastore | Add new Datastore | Add N new Datastores, for N VMs running Kubernetes etcd/Control Plane services | . Which one is “best”? You guessed it - it depends. In all likelihood, though, a separate VMware Datastore (and therefore a new SolidFire volume) would be a good starting point. N new datastores for N VMs (Nodes) would be better for situations where a higher HA is desirable, as a failure or failover of one Datastore wouldn’t impact all etcd nodes at the same time. Multiple Management Clusters are also a possibility, so one could have the important ones deployed across multiple datastores, and less important ones on one dedicated Datastore (or even shared, although Min QoS for such volumes would have to be set with care). The one thing that doesn’t sound like a good idea at all is to put Management Cluster VMs on the same Datastore where vCenter or other non-Rancher VMs run. ez-rancher (and presumably HCC) do not assume that Management Cluster would use PVCs. Default Datastores on NetApp HCI . As of NetApp Deployment Engine 1.8P1, these two get created during HCI deployment: . | NetApp-HCI-Datastore-01 | NetApp-HCI-Datastore-02 | . Personally I’d create one or more new datastores (NetApp-HCI-Datastore-Rancher-0[1,2,3]) for the important Management Cluster. ",

SolidFire and eSDS users can use either approach. | Catalog approach . | Standardized for Rancher with both NetApp HCI and SolidFire | Good for frequent or repetitive deployments | Not all Trident versions may be available but versions recommended by NetApp HCI for use with Rancher should be available | Well-tested updates with documented update procedures specific to NetApp HCI | . | Classic approach . | You can choose to deploy any Trident version (which can be both good and bad; at the very least you should check which Trident version is supported by NetApp HCC - this information could be found in the Trident documentation or by checking the versions deployed by ez-rancher Trident Catalog). In theory at least any Trident version that supports Kubernetes contained in a Rancher version supported by NetApp HCC should be acceptable. But if you want to be on the safe side, check what versions are supported by NetApp HCC with Rancher and use one of those. | Somewhat manual process that can be automated, but also a source of problems if poorly planned and executed | Uses standard update procedures from NetApp Trident | . | . NOTES: . | If you deploy multiple Rancher clusters against the same NetApp HCI or SolidFire back-end you must ensure that each Rancher cluster (and its Trident instance) use a different storage account so that CHAP authentication does not lead to one Rancher cluster seeing PVs from another | When you destroy a cluster, remember to clean up the account, volumes, IQNs, VLANs, etc if you have no intent to use them again | When assigning storage account names, assuming Rancher cluster have unique names, administrators could base SolidFire storage account names used by Trident upon Rancher cluster names | . NetApp HCC Helm Chart for Workload Clusters . NetApp HCC users should be able to deploy it more easily. ez-rancher users can deploy it or add it later. Find it here. Add this Helm Chart v3 to a User Cluster’s Catalog and deploy from the User Cluster’s Cluster Explorer (find it under Apps). NetApp Trident “Classic” . This approach uses standard NetApp Trident deployment steps as documented here. A YouTube video of the process with Rancher v2.5.2 and Trident v20.10 can be viewed here. Customize Trident Deployment for Workload Clusters . | In Trident back-end configuration file, pick a unique (not trident) user name for the Trident account for each individual cluster | On SolidFire array, use the same name or other appropriate convention to “link” cluster name with Trident name | For example Rancher cluster rancher-dc1-az1-mfg-uc01 would use the same account name on SolidFire: | . { \"version\": 1, \"storageDriverName\": \"solidfire-san\", \"Endpoint\": \"https://admin:nimda@192.168.1.1/json-rpc/11.0\", ... \"TenantName\": \"rancher-dc1-az1-mfg-uc01\", } .
