    "content": "In addition to deploying Rancher on NetApp HCI or SolidFire, you may also want to automate related resources: - SolidFire storage accounts (for user clusters) - SolidFire volumes (to create Datastores or pre-populated Trident volumes that can be imported to user cluster with NetApp Trident) We should create a dedicated storage account for each User Cluster that needs to use external SolidFire storage through NetApp Trident. ### PowerShell PowerShell is not often used for Kubernetes, but it's quite popular for VMware. If you use PowerCLI then consider using SolidFire PowerShell Tools. #### Example Adjust the sample script from [this repo](https://github.com/scaleoutsean/solidfire-windows). ### Ansible There's over 20 modules for it, so you can do pretty much everything with it. ### Terraform It can be used for more than one thing, but here are some ideas: - Provision VMware storage for Rancher Management or User Clusters - Use SolidFire Provider to create volumes and add them to existing vCenter Volume Access Group - Use vSphere Provider to create Datastores - Then use ez-rancher to deploy Rancher - Provision native iSCSI storage for User Clusters - Use SolidFire Provider to create storage account (CHAP user name and password) - Deploy Rancher User Cluster with iSCSI Network interface and have it use the storage account to configure NetApp Trident SolidFire Provider for Terraform can be downloaded [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/NetApp/netapp-elementsw/latest). #### Example Follow the example from [https://github.com/NetApp/terraform-provider-netapp-elementsw](https://github.com/NetApp/terraform-provider-netapp-elementsw/). This example illustrates all resources available so it creates an account, IQN, VAG and volumes. Because with Trident we won't use VAGs, we just need to register a new account (consider using the same name as for Rancher cluster) and create volumes. - Management cluster probably doesn't need to use Trident - it only needs three new datastores - User cluster likely needs Trident and a dedicated storage account ### Need help?

These techniques are discused in the Awesome SolidFire repo. ## Tools: Ansible, Powershell, Terraform Considering that ez-rancher employs Terraform and there are both SolidFire (\"ElementSW\") and vSphere Providers for Terraform, for this I'd prefer Terraform followed by PowerShell and only then Ansible. But you can choose any approach that works for you. If you have any of these already in place, that would obviously be a factor. You can find examples of SolidFire storage provisioning with Terraform on YouTube. Awesome SolidFire has additional details on SolidFire automation. ## Automation Almost everything can be automated, but a lot of it isn't specific to NetApp HCI or SolidFire. We'll cover only the parts that need our consideration. One-off actions (such as the creation of a Rancher Resource Pool) may be covered at a later time. - Deploy - Create dedicated storage account and deploy NetApp Trident to User Cluster - Create VMware networks, datastores - Different automation for vSphere clusters with VDS vs. VSS - Rancher Management Cluster has different network requirements from User (Workload) Cluster - Update - Modify storage QoS and back-end QoS in NetApp Trident - Expand volume size or VMFS - Create additional datastores or networks - Destruct - Undo the creation of resources from Deploy phase, including Trident storage account in the case of User Cluster ",

    "content": "As indicated earlier, unless the official documentation or NetApp Support tell us differently, Management Clusters should be deployed with HCC. In this section we'll therefore look at other environments such as NetApp SolidFire/eSDS. In the case you are now wondering what's the difference between a NetApp HCI environment and non-HCI environment with SolidFire, in this context a short answer could be \"NetApp HCI is deployed with NDE\", which also means that: - Compute nodes are NetApp HCI H-Series nodes - Compute nodes run vSphere ESXi hypervisor **NOTE**: Best do not enable node auto-replace on nodes that participate in node pools that use Trident. Rancher considers replaceable nodes to be ephermal which means PVs attached to those nodes disappear together with the node to which they're attached. I have't tested how this affects Trident-provisioned PVs (maybe changing Trident delete policy would help preserve such PVs.) ## Deploy Rancher in NetApp SolidFire and eSDS Environments SolidFire and eSDS users should have mNode and HCC available in their environment, but may not be able to deploy Rancher with it. The reason is the compute nodes where Rancher Kubernetes is deployed cannot be managed by HCC, so we cannot use HCC to do this the way it's done on NetApp HCI clusters. ### NetApp Trident Helm Chart for Workload Clusters ez-rancher deploys it by default. You can also add it later. The chart can be found [here](https://github.com/NetApp/ez-rancher-trident-installer). ### Deploy Rancher Management Cluster using ez-rancher ez-rancher doesn't make networking or other choices for you, so good planning is essential. ez-rancher can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/NetApp/ez-rancher). Edit config file according to the instructions and run the tool. It takes 15-20 minutes to complete.

    "content": "## Management vs. Workload (User) Clusters We should concern ourselves only with Rancher Management Cluster(s) because Workload Clusters are deployed by Rancher Management Cluster (not HCC.) The deployment of Workload Clusters is likely to be much less prescriptive and drive by common-sense Kubernetes-in-vSphere-VMs considerations. ## Supportability For NetApp HCI administrators HCC is the recommended and (perhaps more importantly) *supported* approach to deploy Rancher Management Cluster on NetApp HCI. For this deployment method, please refer to the NetApp documentation for Rancher on NetApp HCI. ez-rancher can be used instead of HCC, but infrastructure-wise a Management Cluster deployed by ez-rancher should be indistinguishable from an HCC-deployed Management Cluster to ensure its supportability. NetApp HCI users could deploy Management Cluster with HCC and then replicate (not literally - we don't want IP address or other conflicts) with ez-rancher - this should be good enough for Dev/Test Management Clusters, for example. If we document those parameters by glancing at HCC deployment logs, we can then use ez-rancher to deploy Management Cluster in a manner consistent with HCC. Of course NetApp Support would be the judge of that, so the only reliable method to get a supported production Management Clusters is to deploy it with HCC. vSphere administrators in a SolidFire environment have access to HCC, but HCC canonot be used to deploy Rancher. The reason is compute nodes where Rancher Management Cluster is deployed cannot be managed by HCC, so that task would be impossible to accomplish in the way it's done on NetApp HCI compute nodes).SolidFire customers can therefore use ez-rancher or any method supported by Rancher (which includes manual installation of Virtual Machines). ez-rancher will be discussed in next section.

If your vSphere workload networks use MTU 9000, you can look into whether using non-default values helps you. NetApp HCI enforces MTU 9000 on iSCSI networks while other networks can use MTU 1500. Rancher Worker VMs may use MTU 9000 on the networks for iSCSI, but they can also work with iSCSI interfaces set to VM defaults (MTU 1500, for example). Other interfaces may not be able to use jumbo frames if vSphere networking does not support them. RancherOS could set MTU 9000 in cloud-init.yaml like so: ```yaml rancher: docker: extra_args: [--mtu, 9000] ``` ",

It also supports SnapMirror Asynchronous which can be useful in the case of LAN-based replication to NetApp FAS or ONTAP Select. It is also possible to use SnapMirror to replicate PVs to cloud-based CVO but bandwidth and security have to be taken into account when planning such deployments.

    "content": "### Disaster Recovery You can use SolidFire native replication (see Awesome SolidFire) to replicate Datastores and Volumes used by Rancher to a remote site. Both local and remote volumes can take scheduled snapshots. ### Business Continuity In essence BC is a combination of two procedures: - Search-and-Replace operation for Trident targets (paths) on PROD vs. DR site - Stop-Reverse-Start (replication) sequence for storage replication These aren't currently documented specifically for the Rancher on HCI solution or even in the NetApp Trident documentation, but use SolidFire, Kuberetes and Trident features and therefore do not directly depend on Rancher itself. In theory we could use vSphere SRM and SolidFire SRA to failover VMs running Rancher, but that would be complicated approach and I doubt we'll see it officially recommended. Awesome SolidFire has examples of how Target IQNs differ between clusters. YouTube has a demo of how PowerShell can be used to pair clusters, create replication relationship between two SolidFire storage clusters. It takes 30 seconds. YouTube also has a (longish, 15 min) video with a demonstration of SolidFire storage cluster failover and failback in a K8s/Trident environment. #### BC through Kubernetes If services running on Kubernetes are designed and protected in a storage-independent approach, BC can be obtained independently of SolidFire storage. Example: a Web site backed by a NOSQL cluster with Web and Database containers spread across multiple sites running indepdent NetApp HCI or SolidFire clusters. ### Backup and Recovery Rancher provides its own \"snapshot\" feature that can backup cluster configuration to a local disk or S3 storage such as NetApp StorageGRID or Public Cloud Object Storage. For cluster configuration I would prefer that over VMware or SolidFire snapshots or backups. For cluster data, you could use application backups or a 3rd party backup software that can backup K8s containers (see Awesome SolidFire). ",

    "content": "## Management Cluster Should you create a new datastore or use existing? Choices: - Use existing Datastore - Add new Datastore - Add N new Datastores, for N VMs running Kubernetes etcd/Control Plane services Which one is \"best\"? You guessed it - it depends. In all likelihood, though, a separate VMware Datastore (and therefore a new SolidFire volume) would be a good starting point. N new datastores for N VMs (Nodes) would be better for situations where a higher HA is desirable, as a failure or failover of one Datastore wouldn't impact all etcd nodes at the same time. Multiple Management Clusters are also a possibility, so one could have the important ones deployed across multiple datastores, and less important ones on one dedicated Datastore (or even shared, although Min QoS for such volumes would have to be set with care). The one thing that doesn't sound like a good idea at all is to put Management Cluster VMs on the same Datastore where vCenter or other non-Rancher VMs run. ez-rancher (and presumably HCC) do not assume that Management Cluster would use PVCs. ### Default Datastores on NetApp HCI As of NetApp Deployment Engine 1.8P1, these two get created during HCI deployment: - NetApp-HCI-Datastore-01 - NetApp-HCI-Datastore-02 Personally I'd create one or more new datastores (NetApp-HCI-Datastore-Rancher-0[1,2,3]) for the important Management Cluster. ## Workload Cluster(s) These could be on new Datastore, or spread across two or more, similar to Management Clusters. ez-rancher allows downstream cluster managers to deploy Trident from [catalog](https://github.com/NetApp/ez-rancher/blob/a31e1fb155f0d85c7a9226f3101cb2a782ef0ea7/rancher.tfvars.example#L7), but they need to obtain a dedicated storage account from VI or Storage Administrator. Again, pay attention to Storage QoS settings (especially Min QoS). Personally I would suggest to evaluate (first in non-production) QoS SIOC to see if helps with intra-VM fairness when Rancher workload VMs are sharing one Datastore/Volume. ",
