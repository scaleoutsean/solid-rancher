If we document those parameters by glancing at HCC deployment logs, we can then use ez-rancher to deploy Management Cluster in a manner consistent with HCC.

Example: a Web site backed by a NOSQL cluster with Web and Database containers spread across multiple sites running indepdent NetApp HCI or SolidFire clusters. Backup and Recovery . Rancher provides its own “snapshot” feature that can backup cluster configuration to a local disk or S3 storage such as NetApp StorageGRID or Public Cloud Object Storage.
