## Welcome to Solid Rancher!

**NOTE**: Because NetApp HCI will be available for purchase until early 2021 and the HCC Rancher deployment feature not developed beyond its current scope, I created a SolidFire-focused micro-site at [solidfire-kubernetes.pages.dev](https://solidfire-kubernetes.pages.dev). The new site has much less focus on compute nodes as SolidFire customers get compute-related advice from their server or Kubernetes vendor.

If you want to browse the older content for Rancher on NetApp HCI, please visit [https://scaleoutsean.github.io/solid-rancher](https://scaleoutsean.github.io/solid-rancher).
